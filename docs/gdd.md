## Concept

### Gameplay Overview  
The player controls one character, its only contrtols are moving around. Attacks will be automatic, always  hitting in sync with the music. As the player starts it will only have one instrument, and the track of the music will be with only the selectetr instrument. As the player level up he will unlock more instruments, and they will be adding up in the music. 
As the player upgrades its insturments, the instrument will have a more important role on the song.
