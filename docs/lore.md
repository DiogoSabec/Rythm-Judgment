# Rythm Judgement

[PT-BR Lore](/docs/lorePtBr.md)

**Rythm Judgement** is an RPG, roguelike, bullet heaven game, heavily inspired by *Vampire Survivors*. It introduces key mechanics in a fresh way, using **music** not only as a theme, but as a divine weapon and spiritual force.

## Story – *The Divine Chord*

Magnus was born into silence. Not the quiet of peace, but the hollow silence of abandonment and pain. His father, a once-promising composer turned alcoholic, sank into bitterness after Magnus’s mother vanished without a word. Their home was filled with broken glass, sorrowful melodies, and a single, cherished guitar—once belonging to Magnus’s grandfather, a famous luthier and mystic.

When Magnus was ten, tragedy struck. His father died in a mysterious fire that consumed their home, leaving the boy with nothing but that guitar—singed at the edges, but intact. With no family and nowhere to go, Magnus survived on the streets of *Armonia*, a city once famous for its musical heritage but now drowning in silence, despair, and corruption.

For a year, he played on corners and in smoky taverns, channeling raw emotion into his music. His melodies stirred something deep in the hearts of listeners—hope, grief, even visions. It was during one of these haunting performances that **Father Abel**, a traveling monk, heard the boy play. Seeing something divine in him, Abel took Magnus to the remote **Sanctum of the Sacred Scale**, a secretive monastery said to be built atop the ruins of the *First Choir*, an ancient order that used music to communicate with angels.

At the Sanctum, Magnus flourished. He learned not only instruments and harmonies, but also the forgotten art of **Sacred Resonance**—a divine practice where music could repel evil, heal wounds, and even channel celestial power. He became a prodigy, his songs said to calm storms and lift spirits.

But light casts long shadows.

At 18, his mentor and closest confidant, **Brother Morgan**, unearthed an ancient composition sealed beneath the monastery—a **Forbidden Hymn** rumored to summon the attention of *The Dissonant One*, a fallen angel of discord. Craving power and recognition, Morgan performed the hymn during a blood moon. In an instant, the monastery was engulfed in flames and screams. The souls of the monks were twisted into nightmarish forms, cursed to eternally echo their final cries in demonic choirs.

Morgan vanished, and the veil between the spiritual and physical worlds shattered. All across the land, **Demons of Dissonance** began to rise, feeding on suffering, polluting the world’s harmony with chaos.

Only Magnus survived.

Guided by fragmented visions, haunted by the ghosts of his brothers, and driven by a burning purpose, Magnus now travels across shattered lands, wielding instruments imbued with divine resonance. Each note he plays is a weapon, each melody a prayer. His goal is clear:

**Silence the demons. Rewrite the Forbidden Hymn. Redeem Morgan—or destroy him.**

## Additional Lore Concepts

### The Sacred Scale
An ancient set of musical tones believed to have been given to humanity by celestial beings. These frequencies can purify, bless, or even destroy evil when played with proper intent. Only a few musicians, like Magnus, can truly channel their power.

### The Demons of Dissonance
Once human, these corrupted souls have been warped by chaotic sound. Each is tied to a twisted musical style:
- **The Bass Beast**: Emits heavy shockwaves that disrupt rhythm.
- **The Screamer**: A banshee-like figure that distorts pitch and causes hallucinations.
- **The Conductor of Pain**: Leads orchestras of suffering with deadly tempo shifts.

### The Forbidden Hymn
A cursed song composed from a blend of divine and infernal notes. Playing it can open gateways to other realms—but at great cost. It's said that Morgan didn’t compose it... he found it.

### Relics and Artifacts
- **The Echo String**: A guitar string made from angelic hair, amplifies righteous fury.
- **Choir’s Tear**: A crystal left behind by a fallen seraph, lets Magnus summon celestial harmonies.
- **The Metronome of Judgement**: Keeps perfect rhythm even in chaos; grants invincibility if used with flawless timing.
